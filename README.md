This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on recommending skincare products based on finding similar ingredients used. For detailed walkthrough, please view the video presentation and source code in order from:

1. [Data Extraction]
2. [Data Visualization]
3. [Data Resampling and Splitting]
4. [Logistic Regression]
5. [Neural Network]
  
## Contributors

- @amabellim - Amabel - Extracting and preprocessing data, applying lexical analysis to convert data into a document-term matrix (DTM) using one-hot encoding
- @spillthebeanss - Kristine - Dimensionality reduction and machine learning model using UMAP
- @NyanMaw - Maw Htun - idk

## Problem Definition

- Can we find a strong correlation between price and rank, within products of the same categories (i.e. within Moisturizers, Cleansers, etc.)

- Are we able to recommend similar products based on analysing the ingredients used?

## Models Used

Inspired by Natural Language Processing models:
1. Lexical Analysis (a.k.a. Tokenisation)
2. UMAP - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
3. Comparison of different cases using Euclidean distance

## Conclusion

## What did we learn from this project?

- Collaborating using Google CoLab and GitHub
- Handling data and extracting key information relevant to the problem definition
- Natural language processing models
- The use of lexical analysis to better read and extract relevant keywords (in our case, ingredients for skincare products)
- Representing data in a DTM, which has a high dimension, using one-hot encoding
- The use of dimension reduction algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and UMAP, so as to be able to visualise key information
- Using bokeh to visualise data
- Using Euclidean distance to compare between differrent cases
