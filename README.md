This is our mini project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on recommending skincare products by finding similar ingredients used. For a detailed walkthrough, please view the video presentation and source code in order from:

## Problem Definition
Detection of patterns in the data to produce a personalized recommendation system for skincare products

- Is there any relationship between price and rank, within products of the same categories? (i.e. within Moisturizers, Cleansers, etc.)

- Are we able to recommend similar products by analysing the ingredients used?

## Models Used

Inspired by Natural Language Processing (NLP) models:
1. Lexical Analysis (a.k.a. Tokenisation)
2. UMAP - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
3. Comparison of different cases using Euclidean distance

## Conclusion

- retret
- ertetert
- ertertert
- eterte
- ertet

## What did we learn from this project?

- Collaborating using Google CoLab and GitHub
- Handling data and extracting key information relevant to the problem definition
- NLP models
- Usage of lexical analysis (tokenisation) to better extract relevant keywords (in our case, ingredients for skincare products)
- Representing data in a DTM, which has a high dimension, using one-hot encoding
- Using dimensionality reduction algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and UMAP, so as to be able to visualise key information
- Using bokeh to visualise data
- Finding similarities
